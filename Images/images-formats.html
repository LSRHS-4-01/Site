  <h1>GIF</h1>
<p> GIFs are used for simple web-based graphics because of their low file size. They are restricted to 256 colors and should be used selectively.
</p>
<h2>JPG</h2>
<p>
JPGs are best used when working with photographs or graphics such as shadows or gradients that have complex effects. JPGs have a wide range of colors available, so you do not have to select a color palette.
</p>
<h3>PNG</h3>
<p>There are two options when working with PNGs- PNG-8 and PNG-24. A PNG-8 is limited to the same types of files that you would use for GIFs. This can give you a smaller file size. A PNG-24 provides an image with much better quality. They can handle transparency much better than a GIF can.
